# Introduction

Visualizing chromosomes is important for  many  for  medical  diagnostic  problems,  but  chromosomes  often  overlap  and  it  is
necessary to identify and distinguish between the overlapping chromosomes.  This fast and fully-automated segmentation solution 
allows to scale certain experiments to very large number of chromosomes.
